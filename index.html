<h1>Isaiah Polite</h1>

<p>Hello! My name is Isaiah Polite and I am from Atlanta Georgia! I came to the J-School to improve my technical ability in certain skills, networking, learning how to get out of my comfort zone, and to learn how to tackle larger projects!</p>
  
<p>In my free time I enjoy studying fashion, creating music playlists, dancing, cooking, and watching horrible reality television.</p>
    
<p>Thank you for reading my short introduction! I am excited to see what other skills and cool tricks I can learn over the duration of this course!</p>
